                    VidyaSphere was born out of a shared vision among four flatmates during their college years at 
                    Government Engineering College, Kishanganj. What started as late-night discussions about the 
                    challenges in accessing quality educational resources soon transformed into a concrete plan 
                    to make a difference.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    Recognizing the struggles that students face in finding comprehensive study materials, 
                    previous year questions, and quality guidance for Engineering, 10th, and 12th standards, 
                    our team decided to create a platform that would serve as a one-stop solution for all 
                    educational needs.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    Each team member brought their unique skills and perspectives to the table - from technical 
                    development to educational content curation, from user experience design to community building. 
                    Together, they worked tirelessly to bring VidyaSphere to life.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    Today, VidyaSphere stands as a testament to what passionate individuals can achieve when 
                    they work together towards a common goal - making education accessible, affordable, and 
                    effective for students across India.
